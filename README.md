QnA <a name="qna"></a>

Common questions and answers related to time series analysis and ARIMA models.

Import Libraries <a name="import-libraries"></a>

The necessary Python libraries for this project are imported in this section. They include:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
statsmodels
Read Data <a name="read-data"></a>

The dataset is loaded and a preliminary plot is created to visualize the data and identify any trends.

Data Transformation to Achieve Stationarity <a name="data-transform"></a>

Log Scale Transformation <a name="log"></a>
Applying logarithmic transformation to the data to stabilize the variance and make the series more stationary.

Exponential Decay Transformation <a name="exp"></a>
Using exponential decay to further stabilize the variance and remove trends.

Time Shift Transformation <a name="shift"></a>
Shifting the time series data to achieve stationarity by removing trends and seasonality.

Plotting ACF & PACF <a name="acf-pacf"></a>

Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots are created to determine the order of the ARIMA model.

Building Models <a name="model"></a>

Constructing AR, MA, and ARIMA models to fit the time series data and comparing their performance.

Prediction & Reverse Transformations <a name="prediction"></a>

Forecasting future values using the ARIMA model and applying reverse transformations to obtain predictions in the original scale.

Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

Summarizing the findings and the performance of the ARIMA model.
